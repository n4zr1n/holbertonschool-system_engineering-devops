1. What is a server?
A server is a computer system that provides services to other computers (clients) over a network. In this case, it hosts the website files, processes application logic, and manages the database.

2. What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-friendly address that maps to the IP address of the server (8.8.8.8). It allows users to reach your website without remembering IP addresses.

3. What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?
The www is a subdomain. The DNS record is usually an A record that maps www.foobar.com to the server's IP address: 8.8.8.8.

4. What is the role of the web server (Nginx)?
Nginx handles:
Receiving HTTP/HTTPS requests from users
Serving static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
Reverse proxying dynamic requests to the application server
Load balancing
SSL termination

5. What is the role of the application server?
The application server runs the core backend logic of the site:
Processes user input
Performs business logic
Interacts with the database
Renders dynamic content

6. What is the role of the database?
The MySQL database stores all persistent data for the website:
User accounts
Posts, comments, products, etc.
Logs, metrics, and analytics
It supports structured querying using SQL.

7. What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer?
The server communicates with the user via the HTTP/HTTPS protocol over the TCP/IP network stack.

Issues with This Infrastructure
1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
If the only server goes down, the entire website becomes unreachable.

2. Downtime During Maintenance
Updating the application code or restarting Nginx or MySQL may cause temporary downtime.

3. Cannot Scale with Traffic
One server limits how many users can access the website simultaneously. High traffic can overload CPU, RAM, or disk I/O.
